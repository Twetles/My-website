            <h3>Gym</h3>
            <p>Staying fit and achieving new strength goals. Currently I am trying to lose weight, to achieve this goal I plan to commit my time in the gym lifting weights, and doing a nice calorie burning exercise like the treadmill, stairmaster, and a bicycle simulator. Part of the goal consists of eating healthy/creating a balanced diet, and getting plenty of rest.</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Listening to calming and energizing playlists. My personal favourite genres of music usually consists of Japanese Pop (Jpop), Rhythm and Blues (RNB), Korean Pop (Kpop), and many other relaxing or chill types of music. My favourite artists consists of Milet, Yorushika, Kenshi Yonezu, Ado, Sayuri, Le Sserafim, Itzy, New Jeans, Bruno Mars, and a lot more</p>

            <h3>Anime</h3>
            <p>Anime is Japanese animation that has become one of the largest entertainment industries. With new Animes airing every season in a 12 or more episode session, has become a watch activty I enjoy and thoroughly spend my free time doing. My top 3 favourite animes are Eighty-Six, Bleach, and Sousou no Frieren because of their compelling and amazing story telling.</p>
